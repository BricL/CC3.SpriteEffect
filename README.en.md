This project was inspired by [Unity mob-sakai's UIEffect](https://github.com/mob-sakai/UIEffect) and aims to develop custom sprite effect for Cocos Creator 3.8+.


## Installation
Sprite Effect is an extension package for CocosCreator 3.8+ and needs to be installed in the extensions folder. The steps are as follows:

>1. Clone the Git repository
>2. Unzip the package and place it in '${PROJECT_FOLDER}/extensions/sprite_effect'
>3. cd '${PROJECT_FOLDER}/extensions/sprite_effect'
>4. npm install
>5. npm run build
>6. Start the CocosCreator Editor
>7. Click on 'Extension' in the menu bar and go to the Extension Manager.
>8. Select the 'installed' tab, and see the 'sprite_effect' extension here.

## How to Use

1. Select the node to which you want to add the effect component.
2. Click the Add Component button and choose the effec component you want.

> ATTENTION! Sometimes the effect may not show correctly the first time the component is added. You can press the Reload button in the effect component's inspector to reload the effect and correct this issue.
